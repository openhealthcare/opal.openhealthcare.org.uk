You can tell which version of opal is installed\nby running this command\n\n\n$ opal --version\n\n\n\nAt the start a new project, Opal will bootstrap the initial project structure, including\na Django project, some core datamodels (complete with JSON APIs) and a general application structure.\n\n\nFrom the commandline:\n\n\n$ opal startproject mynewapp\n\n\n\nThis will create a mynewap directory where your new project lives.\n\n\nLet's have a look at what that created for you:\n\n\nmynewapp/                   # Your project directory\n    LICENSE                 # A dummy LICENSE file\n    Procfile                # A procfile ready for deployment to e.g. Heroku\n    README.md\n    manage.py               # Django's manage.py script\n    requirements.txt        # Requirements file ready for your project\n\n    data/                   # A dummy directory for fixtures\n        lookuplists/        # A dummy directory for reference data\n\n    mynewapp/               # The actual python package for your application\n         __init__.py\n        models.py           # Data models for your application\n        settings.py         # Helpfully tweaked Django settings\n        tests.py            # Dummy unittests\n        urls.py             # Django Urlconf\n        wsgi.py\n\n        patient_lists.py    # these create the [lists](/guides/list_views/) for you application\n\n        assets/             # Your static files directory\n        templates/          # Your template directory\n        migrations/         # Your Database migrations directory\n\n        opal.sqlite         # The Sqlite development database\n\n\n\nTest it out\n\n\nThe scaffolding step has generated you a working project - so let's check that out\n\n\ncd mynewapp\npython manage.py runserver\n\n\n\n\nIf you now visit \nhttp://localhost:8000\n in your browser, you should see the standard login screen:\n\n\n\n\nThe scaffolding step created you a superuser, so try logging in with the credentials:\n\n\n\n\nUsername: \nsuper\n\n\nPassword:  \nsuper1\n\n\n\n\nWhen you log in you should be presented with a welcome screen that shows you the three\nareas that are enabled by default - team lists, search and the admin area.\n\n\n\n\nOpal applications are a collection of single page Angular apps that talk to the Django\nserver-side layer via JSON APIs. The Team Lists and Search options here are two examples of\nfront-end Angular single page apps.\n\n\nTeam lists\n\n\nMost clinical services will need at some stage to generate a list of patients - so Opal provides\nthis functionality enabled by default.\n\n\nThe \nlist view\n is a spreadsheet-style list of patients - try navigating\nto the list view and adding a patient with the \nadd patient\n button.\n\n\n\n\nEach column contains a different type of information about a patient, while each\nrow represents one patient.\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking each row is an \nepisode\n\nof care for a patient - but we'll come to that in a second.\n\n\n\n\nThe columns you see initially are just a few of the standard clinical models that come with\nOpal - for instance the Diagnosis model in your new application inherits from a model that\nlooks a lot like this:\n\n\nclass Diagnosis(EpisodeSubrecord):\n    condition         = ForeignKeyOrFreeText(Condition)\n    provisional       = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n    details           = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)\n    date_of_diagnosis = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n\n\n\n\nReference data\n\n\nYou will notice that the condition field has a custom field type - \nForeignKeyOrFreeText\n.\nThis is a custom field type that we use with Opal when we want to use a\n\nLookup List\n.\n\n\nLookup Lists allow us to reference canonical lists of available terminology as a foreign key, while\nalso allowing synonymous terms, and a free text override. That means that we can ensure that\nwe record high quality coded data, while allowing users an easy way to enter unusual edge\ncases.\n\n\nYou'll need to import the data for a terminology before you can start to take advantage of that.\nFor now, let's use the reference data from elCID (An Opal application maintained by Open Health Care):\n\n\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openhealthcare/elcid/master/data/lookuplists/lookuplists.json -P mynewapp/data/lookuplists\n\n\n\n\nBy convention, we store data in the \n./data/lookuplists\n directory of our project.\n\n\n\n\nNow let's import the data:\n\n\npython manage.py load_lookup_lists\n\n\n\nNow refresh your application and try adding a new diagnosis to your patient. As you start to type in\nthe condition field, you'll see that the conditions we just imported appear as suggestions:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add your own Lookup Lists to your application. \n\nFor more details consult the\n\nReference Data guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nAdd your own data models\n\n\nSo far we've begun to get a sense of the batteries-included parts of Opal,\nbut before long, you're going to need to create models for your own needs.\n\n\nMost Opal models are \nSubrecords\n - they relate to either a patient, or\nan episode (an episode is for example, an admission to hospital).\n\n\nLet's see how that works by creating a TODO list model that is assigned to\nepisodes of care. In your \nmynewapp/models.py\n :\n\n\nclass TODOItem(models.EpisodeSubrecord):\n    job       = fields.CharField(max_length=200)\n    due_date  = fields.DateField(blank=True, null=True)\n    details   = fields.TextField(blank=True, null=True)\n    completed = fields.BooleanField(default=False)\n\n\n\n\nThis is simply a Django model, apart from the parent class \nmodels.EpisodeSubrecord\n\nwhich provides us with some extra functionality:\n\n\n\n\nA relationship to an episode, linked to a patient\n\n\nJSON APIs for creating, retrieving and updating it\n\n\nEnsuring that the Opal Angular layer knows it exists\n\n\nSome metadata fields, like created, updated, created_by, updated_by\n\n\n\n\nNext, we're going to let Opal take care of the boilerplate that we'll need to use this\nmodel in our application. From the commandline:\n\n\n$ opal scaffold mynewapp\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at what that did:\n\n\n\n\nIt created a Django migration\n\n\nIt ran that migration for you\n\n\nIt created a detail template \nmynewapp/templates/records/todo_item.html\n\n\nIt created a form template \nmynewapp/templates/forms/todo_item_forml.html\n\n\n\n\nDetail template\n\n\nThe default detail template simply displays each field on a new line:\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.job\"\n[[ item.job ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.due_date\"\n[[ item.due_date  | shortDate ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.details\"\n[[ item.details ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.completed\"\n[[ item.completed ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\n\n\nForm template\n\n\nThe default form template will display each field on a new line, with some basic\nappropriate form field types set.\nIt uses the Opal form helpers templatetag library.\n\n\n{% load forms %}\n{% input  field=\nTODOItem.job\n  %}\n{% datepicker  field=\nTODOItem.due_date\n  %}\n{% textarea  field=\nTODOItem.details\n  %}\n{% checkbox  field=\nTODOItem.completed\n  %}\n\n\n\n\nAdding TODOs to our Team Lists\n\n\nNow let's add our TODO list model as a column in the Spreadsheet-like list view.\n\n\nPatient Lists in Opal are subclasses of \nopal.core.patient_lists.PatientList\n, and\nthey live in \npatient_lists.py\n files of our Django apps.\n\n\n\nTechnically these can live anywhere you like - although if you put them in other places\nyou're responsible for making sure that they're imported at startup.\n\nOpal guarantees\nto autodiscover lists in `app.patient_list` modules.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the basic list that the Opal application scaffold created for you in\n\nyournewapp/patient_lists.py\n.\n\n\nclass AllPatientsList(core.patient_lists.PatientList):\n    display_name = 'All Patients'\n\n    schema = [\n        models.Demographics,\n        models.Diagnosis,\n        models.Treatment\n    ]\n\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        return Episode.objects.all()\n\n\n\n\nThe columns for lists are set in the \nschema\n property of the PatientList class. To add\nour TODO model to the list, just add the model to the schema:\n\n\n    schema = [\n        models.Demographics,\n        models.Diagnosis,\n        models.Treatment,\n        models.TODOItem\n    ]\n\n\n\n\nRefresh the lists page in your browser, and you'll see your new column on the end - add a\nTODO item, noting how we automatically get appropriate form types like datepickers and\ncheckboxes.\n\n\nYou can edit any entry in the list view by double clicking on it.\n\n\nTweaking the default scaffolding\n\n\nThe scaffolding templates are only really supposed to get you started - you'll often\nneed to tweak the templates they generate with whatever logic makes sense for your\napplication.\n\n\nFor us, you'll notice that the value of \nTODOItem.completed\n simply displays as false -\nwhich is not particularly useful. So let's update that using the Opal\n\nBoxed filter\n. In \nmynewapp/templates/records/todo_item.html\n\nchange the last line to look like this:\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.completed\"\n[[ item.completed | boxed ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\n\n\nSet an Icon for your model\n\n\nYou'll notice that your new column is the only one without an icon - we set the icon by\nadding the following property to your \nTODOItem\n class:\n\n\n    _icon = 'fa fa-th-list'\n\n\n\nSome other batteries included\n\n\nLet's take a look at some of the other core functionality that we now have out of the box:\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nBy default, we also enable the search module, which allows you to search by patient name\nor unique identifier:\n\n\n\n\nDetail views\n\n\nWe also have a detail view for our patients, which you can access via search results. This\nview will typically allow for a more detailed display and editing of all the events\ncomprising a patient's care than is available on the list page.\n\n\n\n\nJSON APIs\n\n\nOpal automatically creates self-documenting JSON APIs for your interacting with the data\nin your application. You can inspect these APIs interactively at the url:\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8000/api/v0.1/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat next?\n\n\nThis is just a glimpse at the full range of functionality that comes with Opal - there is\nmuch more to discover in the \nTopic Guides\n.",

You can see the basic list that the Opal application scaffold created for you in yournewapp/patient_lists.py .  class AllPatientsList(core.patient_lists.PatientList):\n    display_name = 'All Patients'\n\n    schema = [\n        models.Demographics,\n        models.Diagnosis,\n        models.Treatment\n    ]\n\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        return Episode.objects.all()  The columns for lists are set in the  schema  property of the PatientList class. To add\nour TODO model to the list, just add the model to the schema:      schema = [\n        models.Demographics,\n        models.Diagnosis,\n        models.Treatment,\n        models.TODOItem\n    ]  Refresh the lists page in your browser, and you'll see your new column on the end - add a\nTODO item, noting how we automatically get appropriate form types like datepickers and\ncheckboxes.  You can edit any entry in the list view by double clicking on it.",

These are pieces of\ncomposable functionality that can be implemented by any plugin or application,\nsimply by declaring a class with the appropriate fields and methods implemented. (Details\nof exactly which fields and methods vary by feature.)\n\n\nDefining Discoverable Features\n\n\nThe only thing required for a discoverable feature, is that it defines the name of\nthe module in which it should expect to find instances.\n\n\nfrom opal.core import discoverable\n\nclass MyFeature(discoverable.DiscoverableFeature):\n    module_name = 'myfeature'\n\n\n\nThis now gives us access to various interfaces which come with the library. We can access\nall subclasses of \nMyFeature\n by calling \nMyFeature.list()\n - which will look through all\nDjango apps in our application, and look for a module named \nmyfeature.py\n. The \nlist()\n\nmethod then returns any subclasses of \nMyFeature\n.\n\n\nSlugs and Display Names\n\n\nWe often want to define human and machine readable strings to name our features. Display\nnames are intended for people - feel free to include spaces, numbers and punctuation. Slugs\nare intended for machines - so no spaces, numbers, hyphens, periods or other punctuation. By\ndefault, if there is a display name and no explicit slug, we will 'slugify' the display name.\n\n\nclass MyNameFeature(MyFeature):\n    display_name = 'Hello World'\n\nprint MyNameFeature.get_slug()\n# 'hello_world'\n\nclass MySlugFeature(MyFeature):\n    slug = 'this_is_a_slug'\n\nprint MySlugFeature.get_slug()\n# 'this_is_a_slug'\n\n\n\nRetrieving Subclasses\n\n\nOnce we define a \ndisplay_name\n or \nslug\n for subclasses of our feature, we can then fetch them via\nthe \nget()\n api.\n\n\nclass RedFeature(MyFeature):\n    slug = 'red_feature'\n\nMyFeature.get('red_feature') # -\n RedFeature\n\n\n\nSortable Features\n\n\nWe can make our feature sortable via an \norder\n property by including\n \ndiscoverable.SortableFeature\n as a parent class. This will ensure that \nMyFeature.list()\n\n respects the \n.order\n number of any subclass.\n\n\nclass MyFeature(discoverable.DiscoverableFeature,\n                 discoverable.SortableFeature):\n     module_name = 'myfeature'\n\nclass ThirdFeature(MyFeature):\n    order = 3\n\nclass FirstFeature(MyFeature):\n    order = 1\n\nclass SecondFeature(MyFeature):\n    order = 2\n\nfor f in MyFeature.list():\n    print f.order, f\n\n# \nclass '*.*.FirstFeature'\n, 1\n# \nclass '*.*.SecondFeature'\n, 2\n# \nclass '*.*.ThirdFeature'\n, 3\n\n\n\nRestrictable Features\n\n\nWe can ensure that only particular users can access a feature by including\n \ndiscoverable.RestrictableFeature\n as a parent class, and implementing the \nvisible_to\n\n classmethod on any restricted subclasses.\n\n\n class MyFeature(discoverable.DiscoverableFeature, discoverable.RestrictableFeature):\n     module_name = 'myfeature'\n\n\n\nFor instance, a feature that was only visible to superusers could be implemented like this:\n\n\n class SuperuserFeature(MyFeature):\n\n     @classmethod\n     def visible_to(klass, user):\n         return user.is_superuser\n\n\n\nValidating Features\n\n\nSometimes we wish to validate features so that we don't cause unintended consequences when\nwe implement subclasses of them. This is available via the \nis_valid\n classmethod. For instance,\nif we wanted to implement a \"Bomb\" feature, which blew up every time the blow_up attribute was\ntrue, we could to this as follows:\n\n\nclass BombFeature(discoverable.DiscoverableFeature):\n    module_name = 'bombs'\n    blow_up = False\n\n    @classmethod\n    def is_valid(klass):\n        if klass.blow_up == True:\n            from opal.core.exceptions import InvalidDiscoverableFeatureError\n            raise InvalidDiscoverableFeatureError('BLOWING UP')\n\n\nclass Threat(BombFeature): pass\n# That's fine.\n\nclass Detonate(BombFeature):\n    blow_up = True\n# InvalidDiscoverableFeatureError: BLOWING UP\n\n\n\nAbstract Features\n\n\nSometimes we want to declare an abstract feature - something with reusable functionality\nthat isn't itself a new feature. We would rather not have our abstract feature show up\nwhen we \nlist()\n our base feature - because it's simply a programming convenience. This\nis made simple by using \nopal.utils.AbstractBase\n.\n\n\n    class A(discoverable.DiscoverableFeature):\n        module_name = 'a'\n\n    class AA(A, AbstractBase): pass\n\n    class B(A): pass\n\n    class C(AA): pass\n\n    class D(AA): pass\n\n\n    A.list()\n    # [B, C, D]",

A key pattern is to edit\nor create an individual record in a modal containing the form for just that record. Opal provides\nthe Angular Controller \nopal.controllers.EditItemCtrl\n for doing just this\n\n\nCustomising the Angular Controller\n\n\nOpal uses the \nformController\n attribute of an \nItem\n to determine which Angular Controller to use. This\ndefaults to \nopal.controllers.EditItemCtrl\n.

            "text": "Opal Patient List views\n\n\nOpal provides support for displaying lists of patients, both via a spreadsheet like view,\nand with a card based view.\n\n\nDefining lists\n\n\nOpal patient lists are subclasses of \nopal.core.patient_lists.PatientList\n.\n\n\nTypically these are found in a \npatient_lists.py\n module of your application or plugin. (Lists \ncan\n be\ndefined elsewhere, but may not be auto discovered.)\n\n\nA basic list needs only define it's \ndisplay_name\n a \nqueryset\n of episodes to display, and\na \nschema\n of subrecords to show for each episode.\n\n\n# patient_lists.py\nfrom opal.models import Episore\nfrom opal.core import patient_lists\n\nfrom myapplication import models\n\nclass AlphabetListA(patient_lists.PatientList):\n    display_name = 'A Patients'\n\n    queryset = Episode.objects.filter(demographics__name__istartswith='a')\n\n    schema = [\n        models.Demographics,\n        models.Location,\n        models.Diagnosis,\n        models.Treatment\n    ]\n\n\n\nThe \ndisplay_name\n property is the human readable name for our list - which is displayed as\nlink text to our list.\n\n\nSchemas\n\n\nThe schema attribute declares the columns of a PatientList. The entries in a schema may either\nbe \nSubrecord\n instances, or instances of \nopal.core.patient_lists.Column\n.\n\n\nCustom Columns\n\n\nAlthough most schema entries will be subrecords, it can be useful to have non-subrecord columns.\nFor instance because you want to allow a composite\ncolumn of multiple \nSubrecords\n or because we want to simply render arbitrary markup.\n\n\nColumns require the title, and template_path to be set, and are simply included in the schema\nlist.\n\n\nclass MyMarkupList(patient_lists.PatientList):\n    schema = [\n        patient_lists.Column(title='Foo', template_path='foo/bar')\n    ]\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate selection\n\n\nThe list view is constructed by rendering a column for each record, in the order\ndefined in the schema, and a row for each episode in the list.\n\n\nThe template for each cell should live in \n./templates/records/*\n. In order to\nselect the appropriate template for a given episode, Opal looks in the following\nlocations:\n\n\nrecords/{episode_type}/{list slug}/{record_name}.html\nrecords/{list_slug}/{record_name}.html\nrecords/{episode_type}/{record_name}.html\nrecords/{record_name}.html\n\n\n\nQuerysets\n\n\nThe queryset property of your list should contain all of the episodes for this particular\nlist. On occasion we require a more dynamic queryset, in which case we can override the\n\nget_queryset\n method.\n\n\n# patient_lists.py\nimport datetime\nfrom opal.models import Episode\nfrom opal.core import patient_lists\n\nclass MyWeeklyList(patient_lists.PatientList):\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        one_week_ago = datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)\n        return Episode.objects.filter(date_of_admission__gte=one_week_ago)\n\n\n\nOrdering Lists\n\n\nAs a \ndiscoverable.SortableFeature\n lists may be ordered by setting the\n\norder\n property to an integer. Lists will display in drop-downs, tables et cetera, in\nthis order.\n\n\nSlug\n\n\nAs a \ndiscoverable\n feature, the slug for each list is determined by\neither setting the \nslug\n property, or returning a string from the \nget_slug\n classmethod.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTagged Patient Lists\n\n\nA common model for working with lists is to use lists based on the tags assigned to an episode.\nThis allows users to add and remove patients from lists as they see fit, rather than attempting\nto infer it from other properties of the patient (e.g. their current location for instance.)\nwhich can be particularly challenging for some clinical services.\n\n\nOpal provides a specific subclass for working with Tagged Patient Lists:\n\n\n# patient_lists.py\nfrom opal.core import patient_lists\n\nclass MyTagList(patient_lists.TaggedPatientList):\n    display_name = 'Tagged blue'\n    tag = 'blue'\n\n\n\nTagged lists will automatically fetch the appropriate queryset for patients tagged with the tag\nyou specify.\n\n\nInvalid Tagged Patient Lists\n\n\nTag names may not have hyphens in them - Opal uses hyphens to distinguish between tags and subtags\nin the urls for lists, so attempting to define one will raise an exception.\n\n\nclass MyList(TaggedPatientList):\n    tag = 'foo-bar'\n\n# This will raise InvalidDiscoverableFeatureError !\n\n\n\nDirect Add\n\n\nSometimes, we want to control the flow of patients onto, off, or between lists a little more closely.\nFor instance, we might need to ensure additional data collection at points in a patient journey.\n\n\nIn order to accomplish this, we often implement custom patient flows that will programatically tag\nepisodes to tagged lists. In those cases we will want to prevent users from manually adding or\nremoving the tags themselves. This can be easily accomplished via the \ndirect_add\n property. When\nset to false, users will not be able to add the tag for this list.\n\n\nclass MyLockedDownList(TaggedPatientList):\n    tag = 'liaisonpatients'\n    direct_add = False\n\n\n\nCustomising Sort order of Episodes\n\n\nBy default, PatientLists sort according to the Angular method \nEpisode.compare\n. You may override this\non a list-by-list basis by setting the \ncomparator_service\n attribute.\n\n\nclass MySortedList(PatientList):\n    comparator_service = 'MyComparatorService'\n\n\n\n\nThis attribute should be the name of an Angular service that returns a list of comparator functions.\nFor instance, to sort by Episode.category_name then Episode id:\n\n\nangular.module('opal.services')\n    .factory('MyComparatorService', function(){\n        \nuse strict\n;\n        return [\n            function(e){ return e.category_name },\n            function(e){ return e.id }\n        ]\n    })\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file containing your comparator service must be included in the javascripts \n\nof your application or plugin in order to be available on the client.\n\n\n\n\nAccess Control\n\n\nAs PatientLists are a \nRestrictableFeature\n, Access control\nfor lists is set by overriding the \nvisible_to\n classmethod. Your list will only be visible to\nthose users for whom this method returns \nTrue\n.\n\n\nFor instance, we could define a Patient List that was only available to Django Superusers:\n\n\nclass SuperuserPatientList(PatientList):\n\n    @classmethod\n    def visible_to(klass, user):\n        return user.is_superuser\n\n\n\nGrouping related Patient Lists\n\n\nWe commonly require groups of patient lists for a single clinical service. For example a busy\noutpatients clinic might have one list of people in the waiting room, one list of people being\ntriaged, one list for people waiting to see the medical staff, and another for people who have\nbeen seen but need review - for instance because they have outstanding test results.\n\n\nOpal provides the \nTabbedPatientListGroup\n class to help with this case. Tabbed Patient List\nGroups are an ordered collection of related Patient Lists that are displayed as tabs at the\ntop of any list in the group.\n\n\nDefining a Tabbed Patient List Group\n\n\nDefining a group can be as simple as declaring member lists in a property.\n\n\n# yourapp/patient_lists.py\n\nfrom opal.core import patient_lists\n\n# ... Define your lists here\n\nclass MyListGroup(patient_lists.TabbedPatientListGroup):\n    member_lists = [MyFirstPatientList, MySecondPatientList, ...]\n\n\n\n\n\nTabbed Patient List Groups are a Discoverable feature, we expect them to be in a\nmodule named patient_lists.py in one of the Django apps in your application.\n\n\n\n\nCustomising membership\n\n\nThe members of your group can be determined dynamically by overriding the \nget_member_lists\n\nclassmethod of your group:\n\n\nclass MyListGroup(patient_lists.TabbedPatientListGroup):\n    @classmethod\n    def get_member_lists(klass):\n        # return an iterable of PatientList subclasses\n\n\n\n\nRestricting access\n\n\nBy default, the UI for a \nTabbedPatientListGroup\n is shown at the top of any member \nPatientList\n\nas long as there are more than one members of the group visible to the given user.\n\n\nThis behaviour can be customised by overriding the \nvisible_to\n classmethod:\n\n\nclass MyListGroup(patient_lists.TabbedPatientListGroup):\n    @classmethod\n    def visible_to(klass, user):\n        # return True or False appropriately\n\n\n\n\nCustomising templates\n\n\nApplications may customise the UI for Tabbed Patient List Groups by customising the template\n\npatient_lists/tabbed_list_group.html\n.\n\n\nThe default template simply extends \npatient_lists/tabbed_list_group_base.html\n.",

This enables Django error emails which removing any confidential patient data\n\n\n0.8.2.1 (Minor Release)\n\n\nAdds in the karma config to the MANIFEST.in so that we include the karma configs on pip install.\n\n\n0.8.2 (Minor Release)\n\n\nOPAL_LOCATION is added as a system variable when running js tests\n\n\nIf you run opal test js, your karma config is now run in an environment that has\naccess to the OPAL_LOCATION variable which points to the opal parent directory.\n\n\nA Data Dictionary In The Extract\n\n\nThe Extract zip file has a data dictionary with human readable metadata about each field.\n\n\nEnhanced Application menus\n\n\nThe application menu API, previously python dicts stored in attributes on either plugin or\napplication subclasses, now consists of the new \nopal.core.menus.MenuItem\n class, enabling\nenhanced customisation and flexibility.\n\n\nPUT to the episode API returns the episode with all its subrecords\n\n\nPreviously it only returned the episode. Now it matches the episode create api end point\n\n\nEpisode/Patient links in admin\n\n\nIn the admin, episodes and patients lists now have links to the patient detail pages.\n\n\nUser data for the client\n\n\nAdds a \nUser\n Angular service that enables applications to use user data.\nAlso adds some directives to make it easy to render User names and avatars.\n\n\nEpisode.getFullName()\n\n\nAdds a utility method to the \nEpisode\n service that returns a human readable patient name.\n\n\nPlugin.get_javascripts, Plugin.get_styles\n\n\nEnhances the API available for plugins to include javascript and css by adding methods on\n\nopal.core.plugins.OpalPlugin\n\n\n'element_type' argument for the form template tags\n\n\nNumeric database fields are now set as the html5 type=\"number\" when rendering\nthem with the forms templatetag library. This means on mobile devices it will\nbring up the numeric keypad. The element type can now be set via the template\ntag API with the 'element_type' argument.\n\n\nOPAL_LOGO_PATH\n\n\nThis new setting allows applications to set the path at which the app logo is served.\nIf \nOPAL_LOGO_PATH\n is set, the value is passed to the \n{% static %}\n templatetag to set\nthe \nsrc\n atribute of an image in the default application header and login screen.\n\n\nInactive episodes in PatientLists\n\n\nChanges the behaviour of \nopal.core.PatientList.to_dict\n to serialise inactive\nepisodes by default rather than filtering by Episode.active == True.\n\n\nopal.core.TaggedPatientList.to_dict\n continues to filter by Episode.active ==\nTrue by default.\n\n\nNotice of future removals\n\n\nThe context variables \nbrand_name\n \nsettings\n and \nextra_application\n in \nopal.views.IndexView\n\nare no longer helpful thanks to the settings context processor. These will be removed in\n0.9.0 and emit warnings until then.\n\n\nMisc changes\n\n\nAdds a new filter - \nunderscore-to-spaces\n for removing underscores from strings.\n\n\nThe options for \nSymptomComplex.duration\n have moved from the default form template to a choices\ndeclaration on the model. These are scheduled to move again to a lookuplist.\n\n\nThe default value of \nSubrecord.get_display_name\n now uses Django \nMeta.verbose_name\n.\n\n\nMinor fixes\n\n\nFixes a bug where the allergies form rendered the provisional field twice\n\n\nUpdates to the Dependency Graph\n\n\nUpgrades Font Awesome from 4.3.0 -\n 4.7.0\nUpgrades Jinja2 from 2.8 -\n 2.9.6\n\n\n0.8.1 (Minor Release)\n\n\nCookies for the future\n\n\nWe now use the \n$cookies\n api as part of moving to angular v1.5.8.\n\n\nThe default expiry of cookies is now a year in the future.\n\n\nThe cookie name previously stored as \nopal.lastPatientList\n is now\n\nopal.previousPatientList\n.\n\n\nPatients as a service\n\n\nPatient becomes a service in angular. This takes in a patient as loaded by the patient loader or another service. It casts the data to Episode or Item instances as appropriate.\n\n\nPatientList.get_queryset arguments\n\n\nPatientList.get_queryset() is now passed an extra keyword argument - \nuser\n.\nThis is the current \nUser\n object.\n\n\nOverriding default Menu Items behaviour\n\n\nThe \nget_menu_items\n method of Opal Application objects is now passed an extra keyword argument - \nuser\n.\nThis is the current \nUser\n object.\n\n\nThe templatetag application_menuitems now uses this method to render navigation menus, allowing dynamic\ncustomisation of menu contents based on user.\n\n\nRemovals\n\n\nOpal 0.8.1 removes some minor features which, to our knowledge are not used by any applications in active development.\n\n\n\n\nReopenEpisodeCtrl - applications may implement their own 're-open' episode flow, but Opal no longer handles this out of the box.\n\n\nSubrecord._bulk_serialise - this flag has been removed\n\n\n\n\nPending removals\n\n\nWe have re-named \nopal.core.views._build_json_response\n to \nopal.core.views.json_response\n. This will issue a\nwarning for the remainder of the 0.8.x branch, before being removed entirely in Opal 0.9.0.\n\n\nSubrecord List API\n\n\nWe have added a list method to the default Opal JSON API for subrecords - you may now obtain a list of all instances\nof a given subrecord from the API endpoint \n/api/v0.1/$api_name/\n.\n\n\nMisc Changes\n\n\nUpdates the custom \nUserAdmin\n so that the email, first and last name fields from the Django \nUser\n model\nare in the add user form not just the edit user form.\n\n\nThe default test runner generated by plugin scaffolding now uses \nopal.urls\n as the default url conf in the test settings. This allows you to test urls generated by Opal - for instance default form or record templates, or simply raw templates from our generic template view.\n\n\n0.8.0 (Major Release)\n\n\nPlugins\n\n\nPlugins have been refactored and are now \nDiscoverableFeatures\n. This should have no impact on existing\nplugins, however the functions \nopal.core.plugins.register\n and \nopal.core.plugins.plugins\n are slated for\nremoval in 0.9.0\n\n\nWhen creating new plugins we will place the plugin definition class in \nplugin.py\n rather than \n__init__.py\n\n\nopal.core.api.patient_from_pk\n\n\nA decorator that changes a method that is passed a pk, to a method that is passed a patient.\n\n\nToDictMixin._bulk_serialise\n\n\nAdds a flag to the to dict mixin to determine whether the item is serialised as part of \nEpisode/Patient.to_dict\n.\n\n\nFixes bugs in add many subrecord radio buttons\n\n\nPreviously multiple radio buttons for the same subrecord field on the same page would\nnot appear to the user to update correctly. This has now been fixed.\n\n\nAngular UI Libraries\n\n\n0.8.0 consolidates Angular UI libraries bundled with Opal. We have removed Angular Strap, and\nswitched all components using it to their Angular UI Bootstrap equivalents.\n\n\nThis is a breaking change.\n\n\nApplications taking advantage of the \nForms\n templatetag library should require no updates, but will see\nsome minor differences in visual style of widgets.\n\n\nDetailed upgrade guides for the components affected (Typeahead, Popover,\nTooltip, Datepicker, Timepicker) are available in the upgrade reference documentation.\n\n\nDefaults for Client Side subrecords\n\n\nWe pull through default values from subrecord fields into the Opal \nSchema\n and use those values when initializing the relevant\nItem instance for a new subrecord. This should greatly reduce the need to use custom Angular subrecord services to set defaults.\n\n\nChoices in form templatetags\n\n\nTemplate tags that use the 'field' attribute to point to a subrecord field will now infer a lookup list from the Choices of the field if it exists.\n\n\nNote unlike the traditional choices implementation only the last value of the choices is used and saved to the database\n\n\n  Colours = (\n    ('P', 'Purple'),\n    ('R', 'Red'),\n  )\n\n\n\n\nWhat is displayed to the user and saved to the database is 'Purple' or 'Red' respectively.\n\n\nelement name in template tags\n\n\nThe html attribute 'name' for form elements generated with the Opal \n{% forms %}\n templatetag library used to be inferred from the model name. Although this remains the default you can also set it with an angular expression:\n\n\n{% select field=\nDemographics.first_name\n element_name=\n...Your Angular expression...\n %}\n\n\n\n\nModel removals\n\n\nThe models \nTeam\n, \nGP\n, \nCommunityNurse\n and \nLocatedModel\n - marked for removal since 0.6.0\nhave now been removed.\n\n\nAs part of this change, the add episode modal previously available at\n\n/templates/modals/add_episode.html/\n is now not available at the url with a trailing slash.\nAny controllers attempting to open the modal e.g. custom list flows should update their\n\n$modal.open\n call to remove the trailing slash.\n\n\nPython 3\n\n\nOpal 0.8.0 is the first version of Opal to support Python 3. This has meant changing the default\nordering of \nPatientList\n instances to 0 rather than None.\n\n\nMoving forwards we expect all new code in Opal to be compatible both Python 2.7 / 3.4 / 3.5 / 3.6.\n\n\nThis introduces an explicit Opal dependency on the Six module for maintaining codebases that span\nPython 2.x and 3.x.\n\n\nTabbed Patient List Groups\n\n\nAdds the class \nopal.core.patient_lists.TabbedPatientListGroup\n which displays groups of related\nlists as tabs at the top of each member list.\n\n\nPatientList sort order\n\n\nTo enable custom sort orders for individual \nPatientList\ns we introduce the \ncomparator_service\n attribute.\nThis names an Angular service which will return a list of comparator functions.\n\n\nPatientList Arbitrary columns\n\n\nWe now explicitly enable columns in spreadhseet lists that are not tied to subrecords. These can be\nincluded in PatientList schema instances as explicit Column() entries.\n\n\nTemplate re-naming\n\n\nModal_base has now been moved into a folder called base_templates. Its also now got a form_modal_base and a two_column_form_modal_base.\nThe latter two templates add validation around saving.\n\n\nThe standard edit item models and others now inherit from the form_modal_base.\n\n\nAuthorization and permissions\n\n\nAll APIs should be permissioned with Django REST framework permission classes. The default implementation uses\nopal.core.api.LoginRequiredViewset, a standard DRF viewset that requires the user to be logged in.\n\n\nWe now require the user to be logged in for any use of the search functionality.\n\n\nAdded a custom interceptor that logs the user out if the we receive a 403 or 401 from the server\n\n\nForm Validation\n\n\nAdds the checkForm directive\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\nbutton check-form=\nform\n ng-click=\nsendDataToTheServer\nclick me\n/button\n\n\n\n\n\nThis adds default form submission behaviour to the a button. It will check if the form is valid, and if its not it will mark the button as disabled until it becomes valid.\n\n\nIt will also set the form as submitted.\n\n\nWe also now show the required error if the form has been submitted or if the field is dirty, so that the user doesn't get an ugly \"fill this field in now\" message when opening the modal/pathway but will get the error after they click submit.\n\n\nRemovals\n\n\nOpal 0.8.0 removes a number of un-used features that have been slated for removal for some time:\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n - both from the JSON API, and the Angular service.\n\n\nThe legacy APIs \n/api/v0.1/episode/admit\n and \n/api/v0.1/episode/refer\n.\n\n\nThe models \nGP\n, \nCommunityNurse\n and \nLocatedModel\n.\n\n\nopal.models.Tagging.import_from_reversion\n. This one-off classmethod on tagging was introduced to aid with the upgrade from Opal 4.x to 5.0 and has no further utility.\n\n\nThe \nstatic\n argument from the forms \ninput\n tag. Developers should move to the \nstatic\n tag.\n\n\nThe _modal option to set on subrecords. This is because we now use large modals across the board.\n\n\n\n\nMisc changes\n\n\nThe opal.core.api.EpisodeViewSet.create now expects tagging to be an object rather than a list, similar to how it details with demographics and location.\n\n\nThe API will no longer serialise the _ft or _fk_id fields of FreeTextOrForeignKey fields - these\nare internal implementation details of the server that are not useful on the client side.\n\n\nAdds a Unique Together constraint for (Tagging.user, Tagging.episode, Tagging.value)\n\n\nLook up lists now load in from individual apps. The look for a file at {{ app }}/data/lookuplists.json\n\n\nThe default admin url is now \n/admin/\n - rather than \n/admin/?\n this results in more readable\nadmin urls and is closer to what most applications do with the Django admin.\n\n\nThe roles field \nopal.models.UserProfile.roles\n has been updated to be \nblank=True\n. This allows the editing\nof users without specific roles assigned in the Django admin. Although this introduces no changes at the\ndatabase level, this does introduce a migration.\n\n\nUpdates to the Dependency Graph\n\n\nUpgrades angular to v1.5.8 (from 1.3.11) you can see their change log \nhere\n\n\nUpdates angular-cookies and angular-mocks to v1.5.8 (both from 1.3.11)\n\n\nUpdates angular-ui-select to 0.19.4 from 0.13.2\n\n\n0.7.5 (Minor Release)\n\n\nThe flow enter and exif functions now take an optional context argument. When called from PatientList or PatientDetail controllers this is the parent scope when the flow has been entered.\n\n\nNote: The current Flow API is likely to undergo substantial revision in Opal 0.9 / 0.10 do contact us on the mailing list if you are relying heavily upon it or would like to let us know your needs.\n\n\n0.7.4 (Minor Release)\n\n\nAdds  a past filter, future and past filters now take a\nboolean argument as to whether you should include today\n\n\n0.7.3 (Minor Release)\n\n\nFixes a bug whereby celery tasks are not autodiscovered - will have affected users of async extract functionality.\n\n\n0.7.2 (Minor Release)\n\n\nFixes a bug with the copy to category API not setting category name.\n\n\nRemoves the hangover use of options in the list of teams per episode in the patient list\n\n\n0.7.1 (Minor Release)\n\n\nCompletes the refactor of front end data, no longer using the \n/api/v0.1/options/\n API internally.\nThis is slated for removal in 0.8.0.\n\n\nUpdates DRF APIs - we now expect either Token or DjangoSession auth.\n\n\nFixes several small bugs with scaffolded applications -  the setting of \nSTATIC_ROOT\n and\n\nSECRET_KEY\n, generating forms for NullBooleanFields, requirements.txt.\n\n\nAdds an \naligned_pair\n templatetag to the \npanels\n library.\n\n\nUpdates the label for \nDemographics.birth_place\n to indicate that this should be a country.\n\n\nAdds the \nclipboard\n directive to give the user one click copy to clipboard.\n\n\nAdds a \ntag-select\n directive that renders a widget for editing the tags for an episode.\n\n\nAdds metadata to the scope for patient detail views\n\n\nUpdates to the Dependency Graph\n\n\n\n\nDjango Axes 1.4.0 -\n 1.7.0\n\n\n\n\n0.7.0 (Major Release)\n\n\nEpisode Categories\n\n\nRefactors EpisodeCategory to be a discoverable feature.\n\n\nRenames \nEpisode.category\n -\n \nEpisode.category_name\n.\n\n\nEpisode JSON API\n\n\nThe Restful Episode JSON API previously available at \n/episode/:pk/\n is now moved into\n\n/api/v0.1/episode/:pk/\n for consistency with the rest of our JSON APIs.\nThe Opal Angular layer has been updated to reflect this, and\nshould handle the transition seamlessly, but code calling the API directly should update\nto reflect the new URL.\n\n\nDefaults for records on the client side\n\n\nEstablishes a new way to define defaults for records initialized in Javascript without\nrequiring that we hard-code API names to defaults in a global namespace.\n\n\nUpdate to Javascript Signatures\n\n\nFlow.enter()\n and \nFlow.exit()\n now no longer take \noptions\n positional arguments - instead\nthe controllers they initialize have \nMetadata\n and \nReferencedata\n as optional resolves\narguments.\n\n\nAddEpisodeCtrl now no longer requires options as a resolves() option, but requires Referencedata\ninstead.\n\n\nMaxLength for form helpers\n\n\nThe \ninput\n form helper will now infer the max length of char fields from the max length of the\ndatabase field, and render relevant Angular directives.\n\n\nEpisodeDetail removed\n\n\nThe \nEpisodeDetailCtrl\n and \nEpisodeDetailMixin\n controller and service have been removed - these\nwere not used anywhere other than in the Wardround plugin, and redundant after enhancements to\nPatient Detail and Custom DetailViews in 0.6.\n\n\nAdditional utilities\n\n\nAdds a datetimepicker templatetag that will render widgets for a Datetime field including time.\n\n\nAdds a \ndate_of_birth_field\n templatetag that renders a date of birth field complete with inteligent\nvalidation. (Note this change also includes removing the old _partial/ template)\n\n\nUpdates dependency graph:\n\n\n\n\nDjango -\n 1.8.13\n\n\n\n\n0.6.0 (Major Release)\n\n\nDetail views\n\n\nMoves from episode oriented detail to patient oriented detail.\n(All episodes plus x-episode views are available from a patient detail screen)\n\n\nTagging\n\n\nAs a performance optimisation for the frequent access of historic tags, untagging\nan episode simply renders the tag inactive rather than deleting it and relying on\nDjango-Reversion for access to historical data.\n\n\nDate Formatting\n\n\nWe now expect 'd/m/y' date formatting by default.\n\n\nPatient lists\n\n\nLists are now declarative, and separate from teams. They are implemented as\nsubclasses of opal.core.patient_lists.PatientList.\n\n\nForms vs. Modals\n\n\nIntroduces a distinction between a form and a modal.\nBy default, we now use forms for subrecords, only overriding the modal if there\nis something we want to do differently specifically in the modal.\n\n\nCommand line tools\n\n\nAdds $opal checkout for switching between applications or application versions.\n\n\nModels ContextProcessor\n\n\nThe 'opal.context_processors.models' Context Processor will allow you to access your\nsubrecords from templates without having to explicitly load them in a view. In turn,\nthis allows patterns like:\n\n\n{% include models.Demographics.get_detail_template %}\n\n\n\nUpgrade instructions:\n\n\nFull upgrade instructions to work through any backwards incompatible changes are\nprovided in the Opal docs.\n\n\n0.5.5 (Minor Release)\n\n\nChanges the way old tags are handled.\n\n\nTags are no longer deleted episodes, rather they're marked as archived.\n\n\n0.5.4 (Minor Release)\n\n\n\n\nInclude local storage\n\n\n\n\n0.5.3 (Minor Release)\n\n\n\n\nSpeed up loading of the lookup lists\n\n\nFix pagination issues in search\n\n\nSpeed up loading of many to many fields\n\n\nIncrease test coverage\n\n\nAdd some extra help fields to {% forms %} helpers\n\n\nFixes bug with $rootScope.open_modal() where keystrokes were being intercepted\n\n\n\n\n0.5.2 (Minor Release)\n\n\nSpeed improvements on page load\nallow us to only show record panels if a record of that type exists\ndisable modal buttons while saving\n\n\n0.5.1 (Minor Release)\n\n\nMinor bug fixes\n\n\n0.5 (Major release)\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nComplete re-design of Search interface to provide a single search box on every page and pagination for resulta.\nPuts in place a pluggable interface that could be swapped out for e.g. ElasticSearch.\nNew Service for PatientSummary()\n\n\nAnalytics\n\n\nMoves Analytics integration into Opal core with the ability to blacklist pages that should never be reported\n\n\nList view\n\n\nRemoved old spreadsheet-style cell based navigation and moved to row-wise nav with clearer highlighting of the active row.\nUpdated scrolling and loading behaviour to snap to viewport and not display the page build.\n\n\nSubrecord metadata\n\n\nAdded four new utility fields to Patient and Episode subrecords:\n\n\ncreated_by, updated_by, created, updated\n\n\nSelect2 and list fields\n\n\nAdded support for select2 as an input widget and Subrecord fields that can be lists of things.\n\n\nAlso\n\n\nNumerous small bugfixes.\nRefactoring of the models package into a models module.\nUpdated Underscore.js -\n 1.8.3\nUpdated Angular.js -\n 1.3.11\n\n\n0.4.3 (Minor release)\n\n\nRefactors opal.models to be a models.py file rather than a package.\nAdds several improvements to forms helpers -\n Help argument, other argument to select.\n\n\nUpdates dependency graph:\n\n\n\n\nAngular-strap -\n 2.3.1\n\n\n\n\n0.4.2 (Minor release)\n\n\nUpgrades dependency graph:\n\n\n\n\nDjango -\n 1.8.3\n\n\nDjango-reversion -\n 1.8.7\n\n\njQuery -\n 1.11.3\n\n\nD3 -\n 3.5.6\n\n\nC4 -\n 0.4.10\n\n\n\n\nSouth has been removed, now using django migrations\n\n\n0.4.1 (Bugfix release)\n\n\nFixes some search results appearing duplicated.\n\n\n0.4 (Major release)\n\n\nNew Design\n\n\nCompletely re-designed UI following extensive user research and multiple iterations.\n\n\nManagementcommands and scaffolding\n\n\nFeatures the opal command line tool for common administrative tasks\nhttp://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs/guides/command_line_tool/\n\n\n Form helpers templatetag library\n\n\nNew template library for consistent form controls in line with our new interface guidelines\nhttp://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs/reference/form_templatetags/\n\n\nAPI Documentation\n\n\nOpal JSON APIs are now fully self-documenting for all updated instances\nhttp://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs/guides/json_api/\n\n\n0.3 (Major release)\n\n\nBugfixes, significant flexibility in template customisability.\n\n\nMinor UI updates.\n\n\n0.2.2 (Bugfix release)\n\n\nNumerous small bugfixes.\n\n\nAdds the concept of undischarging patients.\n\n\n0.2.1\n\n\nNumerous small bugfixes.\n\n\n0.2.0\n\n\nSearch overhaul - introduces advanced searches.\n\n\n0.1.1\n\n\nInitial public release",

Applications wishing\nto retain this functionality may copy the controller from the v0.7.1 branch\n(opal/static/js/opal/controllers/reopen_episode.js). However we would warn developers\nthat this flow has proven to be problematic and confusing for users whenever\nused - hence the removal.\n\n\n0.7.1 -\n 0.8.0\n\n\nUpgrading Opal\n\n\nHow you do this depends on how you have configured your application, but updating your\nrequirements.txt to update the version should work.\n\n\n# requirements.txt\nopal==0.8.0\n\n\n\nAfter re-installing (via for instance \npip install -r requirements.txt\n) you will need to\nrun the migrations for Opal 0.6.x\n\n\n$ python manage.py migrate opal\n\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nOptions are now an ex-API. Applications should convert to use either Referencedata (canonical terms for common data), or\nMetadata (App specific data you wish to pass into the front end).\n\n\nUI Components\n\n\nThose applications relying on Angular strap ui components (Typeahead, Popover,\nTooltip, Datepicker, Timepicker) should convert their templates to use the Angular UI Boostrap equivalents, or the\nOpal templatetags.\n\n\nIf you are simply using Opal templatetags from \nforms\n and not overriding these templates, then the transition should be seamless. Otherwise, searching your codebase for html files containing \nbs-\n and looking for angular strap components is a good start.\n\n\nApplications or plugins with javascript tests may need to update their includes to remove references to old library files.\n\n\nFull documentation of the markup and options for these components is found \nhere\n\n\nextending modal_base.html\n\n\nWe now have different base templates for modals, forms and two column modal forms (essentially a form with a side bar).\n\n\nThe form templates add validation checks around the saving to catch any validation errors a form might through. They assume the existence of a form called 'form'.\n\n\nAs part of this modal_base has been moved into a folder in templates called base_templates\n\n\nRename any templates extending \nmodal_base.html\n to extend the correct template in \nbase_templates/\n. This will be either \nmodal_base.html\n or \nmodal_form_base.html\n.\n\n\nAdd episode modal url\n\n\nThe add episode modal previously available at\n\n/templates/modals/add_episode.html/\n is now not available at the url with a trailing slash.\nAny controllers attempting to open the modal e.g. custom list flows should update their\n\n$modal.open\n call to remove the trailing slash.\n\n\nAdmin URL\n\n\nThe Admin url has changed to require a trailing slash, so any links to \n/admin\n - for instance, in a custom menu bar, will need to be updated to \n/admin/\n.\n\n\n0.7.0 -\n 0.7.1\n\n\nDownstream dependencies\n\n\nOpal 0.7.1 updates the expected version of Django Axes to 1.7.0 - you will wish to update\nthis in your requirements.txt or similar accordingly.\n\n\nDRF Authentication\n\n\nWe highly recommend that applications explicitly set Django Rest Framework authentication\nclasses in their \nsettings.py\n.\n\n\nBy default Opal now uses session and token auth, which will require a migration to install\nthe DRF Token authentication app.\n\n\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    # ....\n    'rest_framework',\n    'rest_framework.authtoken',\n    # ...\n)\n\nREST_FRAMEWORK = {\n    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (\n        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',\n        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',\n    )\n}\n\n\n\n\n6.x -\n 7.x\n\n\nUpgrading Opal\n\n\nHow you do this depends on how you have configured your application, but updating your\nrequirements.txt to update the version should work.\n\n\n# requirements.txt\nopal==0.7.0\n\n\n\nAfter re-installing (via for instance \npip install -r requirements.txt\n) you will need to\nrun the migrations for Opal 0.6.x\n\n\n$ python manage.py migrate opal\n\n\n\nIf you are inheriting from the abstract models in Opal e.g. \nDemographics\n then you should\nrun a makemigrations command to update to the 0.7.x data model.\n\n\npython manage.py makemigrations yourapp\npython manage.py migrate yourapp\n\n\n\nBreaking changes\n\n\nOpal 0.7 contains a number of breaking changes.\n\n\nName changes\n\n\nopal.models.Episode.category\n has been re-named \ncategory_name\n. If your application\ndirectly sets category, you will be required to update all instances where this happens.\n\n\nThe \n/episode/:pk/\n API has moved to \n/api/v0.1/episode/:pk/\n so any code (typically\njavascript) code that directly saves to this API endpoint rather than using the Opal JS\n\nEpisode\n services should work immediately when re-pointed at the new URL.\n\n\nMoving from options to referencedata and metadata\n\n\nThe signature of the EditItemCtrl has been updated - this modal controller no longer\ntakes an \noptions\n argument, rather it uses the new 0.7.x \nreferencedata\n and \nmetadata\n\nservices. Applications that call EditItemCtrl directly should look to update the \nresolves\n\noption they were passing to \n$modal.open\n. (Alternatively, developers should consider\nrefactoring to use the new \nrecordEditor\n API.)\n\n\nThe signatures of Flow \nenter\n and \nexit\n methods has changed to no longer accept\noptions as a positional argument, and enter/exit controllers will no longer be initialized\nwith access to options as a resolved provider. They will have access to either/both of\n\nreferencedata\n and \nmetadata\n so if your application includes custom flow controllers that\nuse \noptions\n you will need to refactor these to use the new x-data arguments instead.\n\n\nreferencedata\n and \nmetadata\n between them have all data previously in options, so the refactor\nhere should be relatively painless.\n\n\nDate of birth fields in forms\n\n\nThe partial \npartials/_date_of_birth_field.html\n has been removed and replaced with the\n\n{% date_of_birth_field %}\n templatetag in the forms library. You should update any forms\nto use this new tag.\n\n\n5.x -\n 6.x\n\n\nUpgrading Opal\n\n\nHow you do this depends on how you have configured your application, but updating your\nrequirements.txt to update the version should work.\n\n\n# requirements.txt\nopal==0.6.0\n\n\n\nAfter re-installing (via for instance \npip install -r requirements.txt\n) you will need to\nrun the migrations for Opal 0.6.x\n\n\n$ python manage.py migrate opal\n\n\n\nChanges to abstract models\n\n\nIf you are inheriting from the abstract models in Opal e.g. \nDemographics\n then you should\nrun a makemigrations command to update to the 0.6.x data model.\n\n\npython manage.py makemigrations yourapp\npython manage.py migrate yourapp\n\n\n\nYou should note that as of Opal 0.6.x \nDemographics\n now splits names into first, surname,\nmiddle name and title. The previous \nname\n field will be converted to be \nfirst_name\n.\n\n\nStrategies for updating your data to use the appropriate fields will vary from application\nto application, but one good such strategy is to use a data migration \nsuch as the one done\nhere\n.\n\n\nUpdate settings\n\n\nMany of the default Opal templates now assume that the \n'opal.context_processors.models'\n\nContext Processor is available - you should add that to the \nTEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS\n\nsetting in your application's \nsettings.py\n\n\nThe default date formats in Opal have changed - and so you should update your \nDATE_X\n\nsettings to match:\n\n\nDATE_FORMAT = 'd/m/Y'\nDATE_INPUT_FORMATS = ['%d/%m/%Y']\nDATETIME_FORMAT = 'd/m/Y H:i:s'\nDATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS = ['%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S']\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade plugins\n\n\nA number of Opal plugins have new releases to work with the changes in Opal 0.6.x\n\n\n\n\nopal-referral - Upgrade to 0.1.4\n\n\nopal-wardround - Upgrade to 0.6.0\n\n\nopal-observations - Upgrade to 0.1.2\n\n\nopal-dischargesummary - Upgrade to 0.2.0\n\n\nopal-dashboard - Upgrade to 0.1.3\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the \nopal-taskrunner\n plugin has now been deprecated, this functionality now\nliving natively within Opal core.\n\n\nUpdate your Teams to be PatientLists\n\n\nPatient Lists are now driven by subclasses of \nopal.core.PatientList\n, so we will need\nto convert your Teams to be PatientLists. You may want to re-enable the Team admin while\nyou do so - this is simple, by updating your application's \nadmin.py\n:\n\n\n# yourapp/admin.py\n...\nfrom opal.admin import TeamAdmin\nfrom opal.models import Team\nadmin.site.register(Team, TeamAdmin)\n\n\n\nPatient lists are now declarative. For instance, to replicate the following team:\n\n\n\n\nWe would convert that to:\n\n\n# yourapp/patient*lists.py\nfrom opal.core import patient_lists\n\nclass RespiratoryList(patient_lists.TaggedPatientList):\n    display_name = 'Respiratory'\n    tag          = 'respiratory'\n    order        = 4\n    schema       = [models.Demographics, models.Treatment]\n\n\n\n\nThe schema property will likely be available to you in your application's \nschema.py\n\nfile - which is now obsolete.\n\n\nSee the \nfull patient list documentation\n for further details\nof the options available for Patient Lists.\n\n\nForm and Display templates.\n\n\nWe may now be missing some form or display templates, as your application may be\nrelying on templates previously in Opal. To discover which these are, run\n\n\n$ opal scaffold --dry-run\n\n\n\nYou may either create templates by hand, or have Opal generate boilerplate templates for you\nby running \n$ opal scaffold\n.\n\n\nModal templates already in your application will likely be referencing invalid paths\nto their Angular variables. You should update these to include the record name - for example:\n\n\n!-- Was --\n\n{% input  label=\nDrug\n model=\nediting.drug\n lookuplist=\nantimicrobial_list\n %}\n\n!-- Becomes --\n\n{% input  label=\nDrug\n model=\nediting.treatment.drug\n lookuplist=\nantimicrobial_list\n %}\n\n\n\n\nThe Inpatient episode category\n\n\nThe default Episode Category - Inpatient episodes has updated it's database identifier\nfrom \ninpatient\n to \nInpatient\n. To update your episodes run :\n\n\n from opal.models import Episode\n\n for e in Episode.objects.filter(category='inpatient'):\n...   e.category='Inpatient'\n...   e.save()\n...\n\n\n\n\nAny references to episode category in templates (for e.g. ng-hide) or controllers for logic\nwill also require updates.\n\n\nFlow is now defined in JS\n\n\nFlow is no longer defined on the server side in python, but rather is a javascript service.\nSee the documentation for information about setting up custom flows. At a minimum applications\nthat use custom flows will have to implement their own flow service and reference it in their\nsettings.\n\n\n4.X -\n 5.x\n\n\nMigrations\n\n\nBefore upgrading from 4.x to 5.x you should ensure that you have upgraded from South\nto Djangomigrations.\n\n\n$ rm yourapp/migrations/*\n$ python manage.py makemigrations yourapp\n$ python manage.py migrate yourapp --fake-initial\n\n\n\nOpal\n\n\nNext you will need to upgrade the Opal version itself.\n\n\nHow you do this depends on how you have configured your application, but updating your\nrequirements.txt to update the version should work. This will also update FFS and Django\nAxes as well as adding Python Dateutil.\n\n\n-e git://github.com/openhealthcare/opal.git@v0.5.6#egg=opal\n\n\n\nMigrations.\n\n\nOpal has fresh migrations in 0.5.x, which we should run. There are also changes to the\nbase abstract model classes (to add created/updated timestamps) so you'll need to create\nfresh migrations for your own application.\n\n\n$ python manage.py migrate\n$ python manage.py makemigrations yourapp\n$ python manage.py migrate yourapp\n\n\n\nAt this stage you'll want to commit your new migrations, as well as any changes to your\napplication's requirements file.\n\n\nTags\n\n\nAs of 0.5.5, old tags in Opal are stored directly on the Tagging model rather than via\nDjango Reversion. We can import those old tags by doing the following.\n\n\n$ python manage.py shell\n\n\n from opal.models import Tagging\n\n Tagging.import_from_reversion()\n\n\n\nDeployment\n\n\nThe first time you deploy your upgraded application you'll need to run the following\ncommands to upgrade your database:\n\n\n$ python manage.py migrate --fake-initial\n\n\n\nYou'll also have to repeat the Tagging step once for each deployment.",
